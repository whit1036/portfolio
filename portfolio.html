        <p class="fs-5">In Level 2 of my studies, I coded my Adobe XD Mockup website in Visual Studio Code using HTML/CSS for a company redesign of a local Ottawa record store called “The Turning Point”. Furthermore, I designed and developed this website myself! I also used Wordpress plugins, themes and extensions to design a website for my fathers company called “HH Services”.

        <h1 class="fs-1">Photography</h1>
        <p class="fs-5">Level 1 of my studies brought out my love for photography, and an experience and skillset that will last a lifetime. In Photography class, we created a portfolio of images of various styles such as portraits, locations, and dynamics, while adhering to basic manual mode photography standards. Image edits were made in Adobe Lightroom Classic. Click the images below to view my Adobe Photography Portfolio Website!</p>

        <h1 class="fs-1">Graphic Design</h1>
        <p class="fs-5">Level 1 studies introduced me to the world of Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop and InDesign. The fundamentals of vector art, svgs and digital art pieces laid out a creative, and fun foundation to create custom logos, artworks and various designs for digital use. The logo on the left was designed for my company redesign website in Level 2, and the artwork on the right was a custom created artwork design made in Adobe Illustrator.</p>

        <h1 class="fs-1">UX/UI Design</h1>
        <p class="fs-5">UX/UI Design taught me how to create mock-ups of website designs, before beginning the coding process for Web Development. Level 1 studies showcased the art of UX/UI design with theories, and best practices. In Level 2 of my studies, I was taught the fundamentals of Adobe XD, which I have used to mock-up this very website you’re on now! See my XD mock-ups with links below!</p>
