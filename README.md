# Portfolio

## Information Description:

I created and designed a mockup for my portfolio in Adobe XD before beginning the coding process. My goal was to create a simple, easy to navigate, and elegant portfolio website using a modern CSS styling framework that showcases my best work from my first and second semester of studies in the Interactive Media Design program at Algonquin College.
 
During my development process, I came into a few errors and challenges. Initially, I had some font rendering issues for my SVG website logo. Researching fixes for this issue led me to Vecta.io, a website that compresses your svg images, and renders your included font styles to work across all browsers. After downloading the new compresses lossless svg, my logo displays seamlessly across all browsers with the correct font!
 
Secondly, I ran into some issues with the images in my portfolio with text on them, and wondered how I would make it possible to display the image and text responsively across all screen sizes. I found a few great tutorial videos on YouTube that walked me through the process using CSS background images and some media queries, and the result was fantastic! Unfortunately, some of the original homepage images were not looking the way I wanted them to, and I came into some issues with the way the images cropped themselves at different screen sizes. I had to quickly replace them with similar images, to outline the content. In the end, I think the new updated images look much better!
 
Finally, the greatest challenge I faced was learning Bootstrap all together. Before I began the coding process, I had trouble figuring out how I wanted to use Bootstrap's pre-built systems, and what their purposes were for each class. After thoroughly reading the documentation and instructions, things got better the more I coded and I overcame the quick learning curve. I began to figure Bootstrap out for myself, and I could not be happier doing so. I will definitely be finding myself using the Bootstrap framework to code any of my future projects from now on!
 
In conclusion, coding this portfolio website taught me a lot about using the modern coding framework "Bootstrap 5", and how easy and intuitive it is to use their toolkit to build a fully-functioning responsive website. Using Bootstrap's Grid and Flex pre-built systems made it a breeze to style, especially after learning how to style manually without a framework. Of course, learning Bootstrap did not come naturally, but in the end, I created my portfolio almost exactly the way I wanted it to.
