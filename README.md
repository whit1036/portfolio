Information Description:

Throughout my journey in Web Development, I have learned to code responsive websites with close attention to semantics, accessibility standards, and design. I created low and high fidelity digital mockups in Adobe XD as part of my User Experience Design Course. From there, I began to begin to coding process, beginning with my laying out my HTML, linking my stylesheet, bootstrap, and my font scrpit to the head of the index.html file.
