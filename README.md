# Portfolio

## Information Description:

I created and designed a mockup for my portfolio in Adobe XD before beginning the coding process. My goal was to create a simple, easy to navigate, and elegant website that showcases my best work from my first and second semester of studies in the Interactive Media Design program at Algonquin College.

During my coding process, I came into some font rendering issues for my SVG website logo. Researching fixes for this issue led me to Vecta.io, a website that compresses your svg images, and renders your included font styles to work across all browsers. After downloading the new compresses lossless svg, my logo displays seemlessly across all browsers with the correct font!

Developing this portfolio website taught me a lot about using modern coding framework "Bootstrap 5", and how easy intuitive it is to use to their toolkit to build a fully-functioning responsive website. Using Bootstrap's Grid and Flex pre-built systems made in a breeze to style, especially after learning how to style manually without a framework.
